
Firmware for OpenEVSE controller used in OpenEnergyMonitor EmonEVSE units solde in (UK/EU) via the OpenEnergyMonitor store. In collaboration with OpenEVSE.

https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/ev-charging/

Based on OpenEVSE: Open Source Hardware J1772 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment

## Changes by OpenEnergyMonitor:

- Disable `AUTOSVCLEVEL` (autodetection is designed for split-phase)
- Charging level default to `L2`
- Set `MAX_CURRENT_CAPACITY_L2 32` (limit for single-phase charging in UK/EU)
- Add '.EU' to version number
- Enable LCD Redraw every couple of min (required for EMC/CE)

### EmonEVSE

EmonEVSE (non-tethered type-2 EVSE unit)

- `PP_AUTO_AMPACITY`enabled to set max current based on non-tethered cable connected
- Three-phase option with `THREEPHASE`enabled to calculate three-phase energy

NOTES:
- Working versions of the required libraries are included in the libraries/ folder
- PlatformIO / Arduino 1.6.x+ is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for compiling OpenEVSE. Older versions of Arduino will build sketches which are too big to fit into OpenEVSE, unless features are disabled.

## Falsh pre-compiled using avrdude:

`$ avrdude -p atmega328p -c usbasp -P usb -e -U flash:w:firmware.hex`
